        "\n",
        "1.  **Go to the OpenAI API website**: Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)\n",
        "2.  **Log in or Sign Up**: If you don't have an OpenAI account, you'll need to create one. If you already have an account, log in.\n",
        "3.  **Navigate to API Keys**: Once logged in, look for the 'API keys' section in your account dashboard. You can usually find this by clicking on your profile icon or a 'Manage Account' link.\n",
        "4.  **Create a New Secret Key**: Click on the button to 'Create new secret key'.\n",
        "5.  **Copy Your Key**: OpenAI will display your API key. **Make sure to copy it immediately**, as it will only be shown once and cannot be retrieved later. If you lose it, you'll have to generate a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Storing your API Key in Colab Secrets:\n",
        "\n",
        "For security, it's best practice not to hardcode your API key directly into your notebook. Colab provides a secure way to store secrets.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Open Colab Secrets**: In your Colab notebook, click the '🔑' icon in the left sidebar (it looks like a key). This will open the 'Secrets' panel.\n",
        "2.  **Add a New Secret**: Click on 'Add new secret'.\n",
        "3.  **Name the Secret**: For the 'Name' field, use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (this is a common convention and easy to refer to in code).\n",
        "4.  **Paste Your API Key**: For the 'Value' field, paste the API key you copied from the OpenAI website.\n",
        "5.  **Save**: Close the 'Secrets' panel. Colab will automatically save the secret.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, you can access your API key in your Python code like this:"

The toy is exceptionally soft, visually appealing, and has quickly become her constant companion.\n\nThere are, however, a few notable drawbacks. One ear sits slightly lower than the other, and this asymmetry appears unintentional rather than a deliberate design choice, which detracts from the overall craftsmanship. In addition, the plush is smaller than anticipated given the price point. Comparable products on the market seem to offer larger sizes at a similar cost, which raises questions about relative value.\n\nOn a positive note, the item arrived a day earlier than the estimated delivery date, allowing me the unexpected pleasure of examining—and briefly enjoying—the toy before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, while the product is charming and well-loved, potential buyers should weigh its relatively high cost and minor quality issues against its undeniable aesthetic and tactile appeal.\n```"
